Hotspot Google Desktop
======================

A Google Desktop widget project originally written to display readings from Sensatronics devices like the E4, E16 and EM1. The Google Desktop has now been put out to grass so you should consider this project dead.

The Hotspot Google Desktop uses the "Hotspot SDK":https://github.com/openxtra/hotspot-sdk to communicate.
